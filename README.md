##6502 Mathematics
#Introduction
  This project was created for me to brush up on my 6502 skills by creating calculations with the language. Each file does a specific calculation a different way.
#Assembling
  The project is intended to be used for people to read the code, rather than run the code. Nonetheless, the project has assembled files for each program, simply plug the code into an online emulator or emulator of your choosing to run the code.

#Methods
 - Addition 1: This method simply uses the ADC mneumonic to add a value stored at a memory location to the accumulator, and stores the results.
